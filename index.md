# Purpose

The goal of this document is to provide an overview of the Statutory Annual
Statement (SAS) for Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance companies. The SAS is
a comprehensive report that insurance companies must file annually with state
insurance departments. It provides detailed financial information about the
company's operations, including its assets, liabilities, income, and expenses.

# Finding Examples of Statement

The best way to understand the SAS is to look at examples from real insurance
companies. You can find these examples on the website of the California
Department of Insurance: [https://interactive.web.insurance.ca.gov/sas/](https://interactive.web.insurance.ca.gov/apex_extprd/f?p=144:6:17550497214296::NO:RP,6:P6_COMPANY_ID,P6_NAIC:6740,11150).
